# 🐾 Leashless Walking Mode (Owner-Proximity Tracking)

**Concept by Raymond Gaither III – Documented May 2025**

This proposed feature adds dynamic, off-leash control to the smart dog collar system by tracking the dog's proximity to the owner's smartphone instead of relying on a fixed virtual fence.

## 🔧 How It Works

- The owner's phone acts as a mobile base station using GPS or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
- The collar constantly checks the distance between itself and the owner.
- If the dog exceeds a safe range (e.g., 10–15 feet), the collar triggers a warning vibration or audible cue.
- If the dog returns within range, the collar stops alerting — reinforcing good behavior in real time.

## 🚀 Benefits

- Allows natural leash-free walking while maintaining control
- Simplifies setup: no need to draw static fence zones
- Enables adaptive control even when the owner is on the move (e.g., jogging, hiking)
- Ideal for parks, trails, or safe neighborhood walks

## 🔒 Ownership Note

This feature was conceived and documented by Raymond Gaither III and publicly posted to GitHub in May 2025 as original work. All rights reserved unless explicitly open-sourced in the future.

## 📈 Future Ideas

- Option to switch between static fencing and owner-follow mode
- Customizable proximity radius in app
- "Recall" alert button for manually pinging the collar
- Safe zones tied to phone’s geofenced areas (e.g., home, park)
